/*
How DFS iterative graph search works:

Uses an explicit stack (slice) instead of recursion to achieve depth-first traversal.
Explores each branch fully before backtracking (depth-first traversal).
Uses visited map to prevent cycles and repeated visits.

Parameters:
  - graph: adjacency list representation as map[int][]int
  - start: starting node to begin search
  - target: node value to search for

Returns:
  - int: the found node value, or 0 if not found
  - bool: true if node was found, false otherwise

Key difference from recursive version:
  - Uses explicit stack ([]int) instead of call stack
  - No risk of stack overflow on deep graphs
  - More control over memory usage
  - Slightly more verbose code

Stack operations:
  - Push: stack = append(stack, item)
  - Pop: item := stack[len(stack)-1]; stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
  - LIFO (Last In, First Out) - takes most recently added item

Graph representation - Adjacency List:

map[int][]int is a map where:
  - key (int): node identifier
  - value ([]int): slice of neighbor nodes that this node connects to

Example graph from main():

    graph := map[int][]int{
        1: {2, 3},
        2: {1, 4, 5},
        3: {1, 6},
        4: {2},
        5: {2, 6},
        6: {3, 5},
    }

Visual representation:

         1
        / \
       2   3
      /|   |\
     4 5   6 |
        \ /  |
         *---*

Adjacency list breakdown:

    Node 1 → neighbors [2, 3]       (1 connects to 2 and 3)
    Node 2 → neighbors [1, 4, 5]    (2 connects to 1, 4, and 5)
    Node 3 → neighbors [1, 6]       (3 connects to 1 and 6)
    Node 4 → neighbors [2]          (4 connects to 2)
    Node 5 → neighbors [2, 6]       (5 connects to 2 and 6)
    Node 6 → neighbors [3, 5]       (6 connects to 3 and 5)

DFS Iterative Traversal example (start=1, target=6):

Step 1: stack=[1], visited={}
        Pop node 1 → mark visited → add neighbors 2,3

Step 2: stack=[2,3], visited={1}
        Pop node 3 (LIFO!) → mark visited → add neighbor 6 (1 already visited)

Step 3: stack=[2,6], visited={1,3}
        Pop node 6 → mark visited → target found! ✓

Note: Order may differ from recursive version due to stack operations,
but both achieve depth-first traversal and find the target.
